# predictivemaintenance

This project details the work of Predictive maintenance of CNC machine using Machine learning. The
repair or replacement of a faulty machine generally requires higher costs. By monitoring and analyzing
machine data, predictive maintenance can identify opportunities for optimization and performance
improvement. This project uses a Supervised learning model, in that classification algorithms such as
Logistic regression for binary targets and Random Forest for multiple targets are used to train the
dataset, also to predict the labels for new data based on input features. The dataset consists of 10,000
data points stored as rows with 10 features in columns.The main focus of this project is to determine 
whether a machine could fail and if so, determine the natureof the failure. The implications of this project 
could be used for effective machine operation, which can increase productivity and reduce waste.
